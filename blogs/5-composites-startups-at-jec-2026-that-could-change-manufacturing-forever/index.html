              Introduction
            </h2>
            <p class="drop-cap">
              Every March, the composites industry gathers in Paris for JEC
              World — and every March, the most interesting conversations happen
              not in the conference halls of established aerospace primes, but
              in the Startup Village, where founders with prototypes and
              conviction pitch technologies that the rest of the industry has
              not yet imagined.
            </p>

            <p>
              The JEC Composites Startup Booster is the largest startup
              competition in the composites world. Since its launch in 2017, it
              has screened over 1,300 innovative projects from more than 60
              countries, selected 158 finalists, and crowned 34 winners [1]. Its
              alumni roster reads like a who's-who of composites disruption:
              FibreCoat, Continuous Composites, CompPair, Fortify, Vartega —
              companies that have gone on to raise tens of millions in venture
              funding, partner with Lockheed Martin and BMW, and fundamentally
              change how composite parts are made, repaired, and recycled.
            </p>

            <p>
              The 2026 class may be the strongest yet. Twenty finalists were
              selected from over 160 global applicants [2]. They will pitch live
              on March 10 at the Agora Stage in Hall 6, competing for the Grand
              Winner (€5,000), Runner-Up (€2,500), and Sustainability Winner
              (€2,500) prizes — along with a booth at JEC World 2027, media
              coverage, and direct access to investors on JEC Investor Day [1].
            </p>

            <p>
              We have been studying the 2026 finalists for weeks. Here are the
              six that stopped us in our tracks — not because they are the
              biggest or the best-funded, but because each one attacks a
              fundamental constraint in composites manufacturing that the
              established players have accepted as a given.

          <p>
            Before diving into individual startups, it is worth understanding
            what makes the Startup Booster special. This is not a generic tech
            accelerator. It is the only global competition focused exclusively
            on composites and advanced materials innovation — and its track
            record of picking winners is remarkable.

                <h4>FibreCoat (Germany)</h4>
              </div>
              <p>
                Spun out of RWTH Aachen University, FibreCoat developed a
                continuous process for coating basalt fibers with aluminum at
                industrial speed, creating lightweight EMI shielding materials
                at one-tenth the cost of alternatives [3]. Since winning,
                FibreCoat has raised several million euros in venture funding,
                scaled from lab to production lines in Aachen, and engaged with
                automotive OEMs for EV shielding applications. By 2024, the team
                had grown to an estimated 20–40 employees. At JEC 2025,
                FibreCoat presented PolyCoat — polymer-coated continuous fibers
                enabling embedded sensors in composite structures [4].

              </div>
              <p>
                The Coeur d'Alene, Idaho company developed CF3D — continuous
                fiber 3D printing with in-situ curing that eliminates molds and
                autoclaves [5]. Post-JEC, they raised over $25 million in
                venture capital, secured a partnership with Lockheed Martin for
                defense composite components, won Department of Defense
                contracts, and grew to approximately 50–70 employees. CF3D is
                now producing qualified parts for aerospace and defense
                applications.

                This EPFL spinoff commercialized HealTech — self-healing
                thermoset resins that allow composite parts to recover from
                impact damage through controlled heating [6]. CompPair has
                secured funding from Swiss deep-tech investors and Innosuisse,
                launched applications in ski manufacturing (where impact damage
                is endemic), and published peer-reviewed data showing >80%
                mechanical property recovery across multiple healing cycles.

            What stands out immediately: six of the twenty finalists are in the
            digital/AI/software category. The composites industry — long
            dominated by materials science and mechanical engineering — is
            undergoing a digital transformation that is now spawning its own
            startup ecosystem. The raw materials category is equally strong,
            with seven companies proposing alternatives to conventional fibers
            and resins.

          <h2>Startup #1 — Fibionic: The World's Fastest Fiber Placement</h2>

          <div class="startup-meta">
            <span class="startup-meta-item">📍 Innsbruck, Tyrol, Austria</span>
            <span class="startup-meta-item">📅 Founded: June 2021</span>
            <span class="startup-meta-item">👥 Team: 8 people</span>
            <span class="startup-meta-item">🏷️ Manufacturing Process</span>
          </div>

          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          <p>
            Traditional automated fiber placement is precise and powerful — but
            it is fundamentally a serial process. An AFP head lays one tow or
            tape at a time, building up a laminate course by course. For
            aerospace structures where every ply matters, this is the right
            trade-off. But for high-volume automotive, consumer goods, and
            industrial applications where cycle times must be measured in
            minutes rather than hours, conventional AFP cannot compete with
            metal stamping or injection molding on speed.
          </p>

          <h3>The Solution</h3>
          <p>
            Fibionic's founders — Johannes Mandler, Thomas Rettenwander, and
            Elias Hirschbichler (who joined as co-founder in 2024) — took
            inspiration from nature. Biological load-bearing structures like
            bones and wood grain do not place fibers sequentially; they grow
            them simultaneously along stress paths. Fibionic's proprietary FFP
            (Fibionic Fiber Placement) process uses an airstream fiber
            deposition method that builds entire fiber layers in milliseconds —
            not seconds or minutes, but milliseconds [9][10].
          </p>

          <p>
            The result is a reinforcement preform — a "skeleton" of fibers
            placed precisely along load paths — that can then be overmolded via
            injection molding, compression molding, or other conventional
            processes. Because fibers are placed only where structurally needed,
            the process produces zero fiber waste.

          <p>
            The first fully automated production machine is now operational in
            Innsbruck, and it uses commingled yarns — hybrid yarns where
            reinforcing fibers (carbon, glass, or natural fibers) are intimately
            blended with thermoplastic matrix fibers (PA6, PA11, PA12, PP, or
            PET). When the preform is subsequently heated and pressed, the
            thermoplastic fibers melt and consolidate around the reinforcing
            fibers.
          </p>

          <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
          <p>
            Fibionic is not competing with AFP for aerospace structures. It is
            competing with metal stamping and injection molding for high-volume
            structural parts. The 500,000-parts-per-year capacity per machine
            places FFP squarely in automotive production territory. If the
            technology delivers on its promises at scale, it could open
            composites to markets where cycle time has always been the
            disqualifier.

          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          <p>
            Carbon fiber is one of the most energy-intensive materials on Earth.
            Conventional production starts with polyacrylonitrile (PAN) — a
            fossil-fuel-derived polymer — which is oxidized, carbonized at
            1,000–1,500°C, and surface-treated. The process consumes
            approximately 230–300 MJ/kg and generates a substantial carbon
            footprint. PAN accounts for roughly 50% of carbon fiber production
            cost, and over 90% of global PAN precursor capacity is concentrated
            in Japan, the United States, and China [11].
          </p>
          <p>
            For an industry that sells its products on the promise of
            lightweighting for sustainability, the carbon footprint of carbon
            fiber itself is an uncomfortable contradiction.
          </p>

          <h3>The Solution</h3>
          <p>
            CGreen replaces fossil PAN with cellulose sourced from recycled
            paper and recycled cotton [12][13]. The company is the product of
            ten years of R&D conducted within the FORCE project, led by IRT
            Jules Verne and supported by Forvia (formerly Faurecia). The
            proprietary spinning and carbonization processes are designed to
            produce carbon fibers with mechanical properties competitive with
            standard-modulus PAN-based fibers while cutting the CO₂ footprint by
            a factor of three [12].

            CGreen is not the first to explore cellulose-based carbon fiber —
            the concept dates to Edison's carbonized bamboo lamp filaments. But
            previous cellulose-based fibers suffered from inferior tensile
            strength compared to PAN. What makes CGreen credible is the decade
            of systematic R&D behind it, the backing of IRT Jules Verne
            (France's premier advanced manufacturing research institute), and
            the use of recycled rather than virgin cellulose.

          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          <p>
            Tooling is the composites industry's dirty secret. For every unique
            composite part geometry, a dedicated mold must be designed, machined
            (typically from Invar, steel, or aluminum), validated, and
            maintained. Tooling costs represent 30–60% of total composite part
            cost for low-to-medium volume production. Lead times for
            aerospace-quality tools run 8–16 weeks. And when a design iteration
            changes the part geometry by even a few millimeters, the tool often
            needs to be remade.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the single biggest reason composites cannot compete with
            metals for low-volume, high-mix production: the economics only work
            when the tooling cost is amortized over thousands of identical
            parts.
          </p>

          <h3>The Solution</h3>
          <p>
            Fyous has built what they call PolyMorphic Moulding — a mold made of
            more than 28,000 densely packed, individually addressable pins that
            can be digitally reconfigured into any freeform surface
            [14][15][16]. A flexible interpolation membrane sits over the pin
            array to create a smooth mold surface. The entire system
            reconfigures in under 20 minutes.

          </p>

          <p>
            The first commercial system, the PM-01, supports molding, casting,
            vacuum forming, and composite layup processes [15]. Fyous is
            targeting applications across footwear, orthotics, medical devices,
            aerospace prototyping, and architectural panels.
          </p>

          <h3>Why This Matters for Composites</h3>
          <p>
            The implications for composite manufacturing are profound. Consider
            the aerospace MRO (maintenance, repair, overhaul) sector: every
            composite repair patch requires a caul plate or mold matched to the
            damaged area's geometry. Today, these are either machined
            (expensive, slow) or approximated (compromising repair quality). A
            PolyMorphic mold could be digitally configured to match the exact
            repair geometry in minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            For R&D and prototyping, the calculus changes entirely. Instead of
            committing $50K to a tool before validating a design, engineers can
            iterate through dozens of geometries on the same machine in a single
            day.

          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          <p>
            Composites R&D is painfully slow. Qualifying a new material system
            for aerospace can take 5–10 years and millions of dollars. The
            industry generates enormous volumes of test data — coupon-level
            mechanical properties, process parameters, failure modes,
            environmental aging — but this knowledge is fragmented across PDF
            reports, proprietary databases, tribal expertise, and decades of
            published literature. When an engineer needs to know whether a
            specific resin system has been tested at a specific temperature with
            a specific fiber architecture, the answer is usually buried
            somewhere — but finding it requires hours of manual searching.
          </p>
          <p>
            The result is a chronic cycle of reinvention. Teams unknowingly
            repeat experiments, miss relevant prior art, and default to
            conservative designs because the cost of exploring alternatives is
            too high.
          </p>

          <h3>The Solution</h3>
          <p>
            Novium is building a generative AI platform that transforms
            fragmented knowledge into structured intelligence [17][18]. The
            platform enables R&D teams to explore possibilities, anticipate
            outcomes, and make confident decisions before committing to physical
            testing.
          </p>
          <p>
            While specific technical architecture details are limited at this
            stage, the value proposition targets the core bottleneck: converting
            the composites industry's vast but disorganized knowledge base into
            an actionable decision-support system. This means not just search
            (finding relevant data) but synthesis (connecting data points across
            sources to generate insights) and generation (proposing experimental
            designs, material combinations, or process parameters that optimize
            for multiple objectives simultaneously).
          </p>

          <h3>The Context</h3>
          <p>
            Novium is riding a wave of AI adoption in materials science.
            Companies like Materials Zone, Citrine Informatics, and Uncountable
            have demonstrated that machine learning can accelerate materials
            development cycles by 2–5× in adjacent industries (polymers, alloys,
            coatings). But composites present unique challenges: the design
            space is enormous (fiber type × resin × architecture × process ×
            environment), the data is highly heterogeneous, and the physics of
            failure is anisotropic and scale-dependent.
          </p>
          <p>
            A generative AI platform purpose-built for composites — rather than
            adapted from metals or pharmaceuticals — could unlock significant
            R&D productivity gains across the industry.
          </p>

          <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
          <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>
              The composites industry's competitive battleground is shifting
              from materials to data. The companies that can qualify new
              material systems fastest, optimize processes with fewer physical
              trials, and extract insights from their accumulated test data will
              win. Novium's bet is that AI is the lever.

          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          <p>
            A composite part has no memory. Once it leaves the factory floor,
            its manufacturing history — cure cycle parameters, layup sequence,
            resin batch, fiber lot, operator, ambient conditions — exists only
            in paper travelers or disconnected databases. During its service
            life, maintenance events, repairs, and loading history are tracked
            (if at all) in separate systems. At end of life, a recycler picking
            up a composite panel cannot tell what resin system it contains, what
            fiber type, or whether it has been contaminated — making intelligent
            recycling impossible.
          </p>

            mandating Digital Product Passports (DPPs) for a growing list of
            product categories. Composites — complex multi-material structures
            with long service lives and significant end-of-life challenges — are
            exactly the kind of products that DPPs are designed for.
          </p>

          <h3>The Solution</h3>
          <p>
            P2M's GENE.SYS system embeds a chip directly into the composite part
            during manufacturing, creating what the company calls the "digital
            DNA" of the product [19][20]. This chip carries a unique identifier
            linked to a cloud database that tracks the part across its entire
            lifecycle:

          <p>
            The technology is already being deployed commercially. Italia Yachts
            has become the first shipyard to integrate GENE.SYS, using it to
            track composite yacht components from production through maintenance
            [20].

            Startup #6 — Plastalyst (AC Biode): Recycling the "Unrecyclable" at
            Low Temperature

          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          <p>
            Thermoset composites are, by chemistry, permanent. Epoxy, polyester,
            and vinyl ester resins cure through irreversible cross-linking —
            once set, they cannot be melted, reshaped, or dissolved under normal
            conditions. This makes thermoset composites functionally
            unrecyclable by conventional means.
          </p>
          <p>Current recycling options are limited:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Mechanical grinding:</strong> Produces low-value filler
              material with destroyed fiber properties
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pyrolysis (500–700°C):</strong> Burns away the resin but
              degrades fiber properties by 30–50%, and is energy-intensive
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Conventional solvolysis:</strong> Uses harsh solvents at
              elevated temperatures and pressures
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            With approximately 30,000 tonnes of composite waste generated
            annually in Europe alone — and the first generation of wind turbine
            blades and aircraft structures now reaching end of life — the gap
            between "lightweight for sustainability" and "impossible to recycle"
            is becoming a reputational and regulatory crisis for the composites
            industry.
          </p>

          <h3>The Solution</h3>
          <p>
            Plastalyst is a catalytic hydrolysis process developed by AC Biode
            that decomposes polymers into their constituent monomers at
            temperatures at or below 200°C, using only water as a solvent
            [21][22]. No harsh chemicals. No extreme temperatures. No precious
            or rare-earth metal catalysts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The process works on a wide spectrum of polymers — including
            challenging multilayer and deteriorated plastics that are considered
            unrecyclable by conventional means. AC Biode has demonstrated the
            ability to recycle PET back into terephthalic acid (TPA) and
            methanol — a true monomer-level recycling that enables production of
            virgin-quality material from waste [21].

            AC Biode is currently testing at 1.2-tonne scale for PET, PVC, PE,
            PP, and mixed plastics [21]. The extension to thermoset composite
            waste — epoxy/carbon fiber and polyester/glass fiber — is a natural
            next step given that the catalytic hydrolysis mechanism can break
            ester and amide bonds in the cross-linked network.
          </p>

          <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
          <p>
            If Plastalyst can deliver on its promise for thermoset composites at
            industrial scale, it resolves the composites industry's deepest
            sustainability contradiction. The same technology that makes
            structures lighter and more fuel-efficient would finally have a
            viable end-of-life pathway. Combined with P2M's GENE.SYS for
            material identification, you begin to see a complete circular
            economy infrastructure for composites: manufacture → track →
            identify → recycle at low temperature → reuse.

                mounts on any industrial robot — the thesis was the same:
                aerospace-grade composite technology should not require
                aerospace-grade budgets. The technology should be accessible to
                university labs, SMEs, and Tier 2/3 suppliers that are building
                the future supply chain.

              The JEC Startup Booster class of 2026 is proof that this
              democratization impulse is not unique to us. It is a movement.

          <h2>What to Watch on March 10</h2>

          <p>If you are at JEC World 2026, here is what we recommend:</p>

                <p>
                  The first pitch session features 10 startups in rapid
                  succession. The energy is different from conference
                  presentations — these are founders, not corporate speakers.

                <p>
                  Beyond the Booster finalists, JEC 2026 hosts 60+ startups
                  across the exhibition floor. Some of the most interesting
                  technologies we have encountered were found not on the Agora
                  stage but in 3×3 meter booths, tucked between the established
                  exhibitors.

                  If you are investing in or partnering with composites
                  startups, this is the most concentrated opportunity to meet
                  founders in one-to-one sessions.

                  Three winners will be announced. Based on past editions, the
                  winner announcement itself is less important than the
                  conversations it sparks.

                As the author of the Addcomposites blog, Pravin Luthada's
                insights are forged from a distinguished career in advanced
                materials, beginning as a space scientist at the Indian Space
                Research Organisation (ISRO). During his tenure, he gained
                hands-on expertise in manufacturing composite components for
                satellites and launch vehicles, where he witnessed firsthand the
                prohibitive costs of traditional Automated Fiber Placement (AFP)
                systems. This experience became the driving force behind his
                entrepreneurial venture, Addcomposites Oy, which he co-founded
                and now leads as CEO. The company is dedicated to democratizing
                advanced manufacturing by developing patented, plug-and-play AFP
                toolheads that make automation accessible and affordable. This
                unique journey from designing space-grade hardware to leading a
                disruptive technology company provides Pravin with a
                comprehensive, real-world perspective that informs his writing
                on the future of the composites industry.
